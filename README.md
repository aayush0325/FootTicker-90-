This is my submission for DebugIt 2024 COPS-IITBHU

Introducing to you FootTicker 90'! this is a dynamic score keeper for football games inspired by cricheroes android app. this website gives us the functionality to track all the important stats of a football game.

you can track goals scored by a team and goalscorers, shots, yellow cards, red cards, injuries, tackles etc

you can track injuries and red cards which would ensure that only the players actually playing can score 

the feature i am most excited to present is the dynamic possession bar which updates every second and displays how much percent of the time has a team had the ball for automatically given that you instruct which team has the ball.

!!!PLEASE FIND THE DEMONSTRATION VIDEO IN "main/demo vid"!!!

this project has helped me understand browser localstorage, events in javascript and dom manipulation using js. working with a vast amount of variables across files was a great learning experience for me and i look forward to the challenges ahead in my tech journey :)
